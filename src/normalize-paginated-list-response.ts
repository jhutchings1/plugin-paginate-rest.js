/**
 * Some “list” response that can be paginated have a different response structure
 *
 * They have a `total_count` key in the response (search also has `incomplete_results`,
 * /installation/repositories also has `repository_selection`), as well as a key with
 * the list of the items which name varies from endpoint to endpoint:
 *
 * - https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#example (key `items`)
 * - https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#response-3 (key: `check_runs`)
 * - https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/suites/#response-1 (key: `check_suites`)
 * - https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/installations/#list-repositories (key: `repositories`)
 * - https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/installations/#list-installations-for-a-user (key `installations`)
 *
 * Octokit normalizes these responses so that paginated results are always returned following
 * the same structure. One challenge is that if the list response has only one page, no Link
 * header is provided, so this header alone is not sufficient to check wether a response is
 * paginated or not. For the exceptions with the namespace, a fallback check for the route
 * paths has to be added in order to normalize the response. We cannot check for the total_count
 * property because it also exists in the response of Get the combined status for a specific ref.
